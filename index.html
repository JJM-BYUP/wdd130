            <p>Hi! My name is Jennifer Merritt and I live in the town of Afton, Wyoming, USA.
                I enjoy being in the outdoors with my family, taking road trips (I love oceans and mountains!), 
                reading and listening to audiobooks, crafts, rockhounding, and being a grandma.
                My family consists of my husband, three boys, a daughter-in-law,
                a future daughter-in-law, a grandson, and a brand new grandaughter. I've held an ecclectic
                list of jobs from fast food, house cleaning, newspaper business route driver, EMT, phlebotomist,
                and Elementary School and (currently) Middle School lunch lady as the baker. In Pathway, I have 
                already completed my first certificate as a Technical Support Engineer and am starting on my 
                second certificate in Web and Computer Programming. I am looking forward to taking this class.</p>

            <p>Wyoming is a US state that encompasses areas of mountains, deserts, and plains. It is the
                least populated state in our country despite being the 10th largest state in the USA.
                However, there is lots of wildlife, snow, and long-distance driving. Sites to see include
                Yellowstone National Park, the Grand Tetons, (and in my town) the Intermittent Springs.
                Things to do include summer and winter outdoor recreational activities, site-seeing, and
                cultural events. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Velit facilis
