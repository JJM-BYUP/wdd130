        <p>Hi! My name is Jennifer Merritt and I live in the town of Afton, Wyoming, USA.
            I enjoy being in the outdoors, taking road trips, reading, crafts, and being a grandma.
            I am starting on my second certificate at BYU-Pathway and I'm looking forward to
            taking this class.</p>

        <p>Wyoming is a US state that encompasses areas of mountains, deserts, and plains. It is the
            least populated state in our country despite being the 10th largest state in the USA.
            However, there is lots of wildlife, snow, and long-distance driving. Sites to see include
            Yellowstone National Park, the Grand Tetons, (and in my town) the Intermittent Springs.
            Things to do include summer and winter outdoor recreational activities, site-seeing, and
            cultural events.
